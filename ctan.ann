Version 0.9
    
### Changed
 - |\tag_finish_structure:| is no longer a public command.
 - lua mc-attributes are now global again
 - |\tagmcbegin| and |\tagmcend| not longer ignore/remove spaces.
 - space code has been separated and can be used without active tagging
 - code has been reviewed and documented, many internal corrections.
 - code is now in mostly one sty (with the exception of the mc-code)

### Removed
 - |check-tags| key. This is now done with the log-level. 
 - |global-mc| key. No longer needed as attributes are global again.
 - user command  |\tagpdfget|, probably unneeded. 
 
### Added
 - key |activate| which opens the main structure
 - |\ShowTagging| command for debugging.
 - code documentation
